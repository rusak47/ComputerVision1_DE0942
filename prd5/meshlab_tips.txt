3. Instant pretty view (do this once inside MeshLab)

Press 5 → shaded view
Press Ctrl + A → selects everything
Click Render → Shaders → “MatCap” → “Pearl” (or “Skin” – looks amazing on faces)
Press F → fills the window perfectly
Mouse wheel = zoom, left-click drag = rotate

Bonus: To see the texture perfectly

In MeshLab: Filters → Texture → Parameterization + Texturing from Vertex Color (if texture looks broken)
Or just use Render → Shaders → “Normal Map + Texture”
